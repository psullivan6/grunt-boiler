# Run Locally
***stuff you need to DO before any of this will work***

1. Navigate to the `/build` directory: `$: cd build/`
1. Install all the *node* package dependencies: `$: npm install`
1. Install all the *bower* package dependencies: `$: bower install`

## To-Dos

* add different branches for JADE, HTML, etc... versions
    * still worth setting some defaults like SASS instead of LESS, always
* add a new branch for squarepsace setup...use existing code and grunt-init if possible
* add includes section for the boilerplate code for the `<head>`
* add includes section for the boilerplate code for the footer scripts
* add as much html 5 boilerplate code as possible
* tag release when all of this stuff is pretty much done
* use `/build` and `/dist` for root-level directories
